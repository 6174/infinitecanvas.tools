_Reinventing Comics: How Imagination and Technology Are Revolutionizing an Art
Form_ is the thematic sequel to Scott McCloud's _Understanding Comics_. The book
is divided into twelve potential revolutions in how people create, read and
perceive comics.

The last of these revolutions is what McCloud called "The Infinite Canvas." This
concept breaks from the sequential flow of comics by embracing computing
technology. Instead of the computer monitor representing a page, it would
represent a window onto an endless canvas that continues on all directions.
