The first version of Sketch was released to the public in late 2010 by the Dutch
company Bohemian Coding (later renamed to Sketch B.V.). It started out as a
vector image editing tool, but soon found traction as a design tool. Adobe's
abandonment of Fireworks in 2012 and Sketch's design-focused features like
Symbols further cemented it as a favorite among design teams.
