        <h2>We think spatially</h2>
        <p>
          People have been organizing and processing information spatially for
          centuries, whether it be with notes in a notebook or bulletin boards
          with stickies and photos.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of work uses a parts of our brain dedicated to spatial
          navigation.

        <h2>Software that mirrors how we think</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional tools like text editors and presentation software have
          linear interfaces that mimic their output.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infinite canvas tools instead embrace the messy, circuitous paths we
          take when brainstorming, sketching and distilling ideas.

      <h2>What makes an infinite canvas?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Expansiveness</h3>
          <p>
            A seemingly limitless canvas allows for free thinking and creation
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Zoom</h3>
          <p>
            Different zoom levels mimic stepping into and stepping away in the
            real world
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Direct manipulation</h3>
          <p>
            Direct manipulation of objects including freeform movement, editing
            and duplication
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            Real time collaboration combines the best of software and working
            together in person
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        There is a long lineage of software built around an infinite canvas.

      This site draws from our excitement about the growing infinite canvas
      idea. We hope to inspire you to build and use these tools.
